# Installing Microsoft TrueType Fonts on Linux with/without internet

## Online Installation

1) Install the following packages:

```
yum install rpm-build
yum install ttmkfdir
yum install xfs
yum install chkfontpath
```

2) Install CABExtract tool

```
yum install cabextract
```

If above fails, you may download the rpm package and install it

```
wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/8/Everything/x86_64/Packages/c/cabextract-1.9-7.el8.x86_64.rpm
yum install cabextract-1.9-7.el8.x86_64.rpm
```

3) Install MSTTCoreFonts:

```
wget http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/msttcorefonts-2.5-1.spec
rpmbuild -ba msttcorefonts-2.5-1.spec
```

If above rpmbuild command is successful it writes few lines before the end the messages similar to:

Example	
Copy Code
Wrote: /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS/msttcorefonts-2.5-1.src.rpm
Wrote: /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/noarch/msttcorefonts-2.5-1.noarch.rpm
Check for the path where msttcorefonts-2.5-1.noarch.rpm is located as the result of rpmbuild command above. Use that path in the next command:

```
yum localinstall --nogpgcheck /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/noarch/msttcorefonts-2.5-1.noarch.rpm
```
